Clarification Questions
1. Color Scheme Preference
Looking at your design inspirations, I see two distinct approaches:

Option A (Light theme inspiration): Teal/dark green primary with cream/white backgrounds and soft green accents
Option B (Dark theme inspiration): Lime/yellow-green accents on dark charcoal with purple/lavender data visualization

Would you like me to use these specific color schemes from the inspirations, or would you prefer I propose an alternative palette that better suits a pharmacy management system while maintaining the aesthetic principles?
2. Brand Identity Elements
Do you have specific brand colors, logo colors, or existing brand guidelines for bizPharma that I should incorporate into the style guide?
3. Data Visualization Priority
Given bizPharma's heavy emphasis on analytics and reporting (sales trends, inventory charts, financial dashboards), which chart/graph style resonates more with your vision:

The heatmap/calendar style shown in the dark theme
The bar chart/line graph style from the light theme
A different approach altogether

4. Accessibility Requirements
Beyond WCAG AA compliance, are there specific accessibility features you want emphasized (e.g., extra-large text support for elderly pharmacists, high-contrast mode for visually impaired users)?
5. Animation Philosophy
For the "beautiful yet subtle animations" mentioned in your guidelines, what's your preference:

Micro-interactions focused (button states, loading indicators)
Spatial transitions emphasized (screen-to-screen navigation)
Both equally weighted

6. Mobile vs Desktop Priority
Since this is a cross-platform app, which experience should feel more "native":

Mobile-first (POS operations optimized, desktop adapts)
Desktop-first (back-office operations optimized, mobile simplified)
Equal weight on both

7. Icon Style
What icon style preference:

Outlined/line icons (more modern, breathable)
Filled/solid icons (more traditional, clearer)
Mixed approach (filled for active states, outlined for inactive)

8. Card Elevation Strategy
For the pharmacy's operational screens (POS, inventory, procurement), preferred approach:

Minimal elevation with subtle borders (flatter, cleaner)
Prominent shadows for clear hierarchy (more dimensional)
Context-dependent (flat for data entry, elevated for dashboards)

3. The Heat Map/Calendar Style shown in the dark theme. 
4. No accessibility requirements beyond WCAG AA 2.1 compliance. 
5. Micro-interactions focused (button states, loading indicators)  . For loading states, we will use shimmer animations. 
6. Desktop first. 
7. Outlined/line icons (more modern, breathable). Filled icons only on certain state of selection. 
8. Minimal but progressive elevation with subtle borders and shadows (flatter, cleaner).
