Clarifying Questions
1. For the Anonymous Trial to Paid Conversion flow - when users upgrade from anonymous to authenticated, should we implement a progressive onboarding that guides them through setting up critical business data (suppliers, initial inventory, first location) immediately after payment, or allow them to continue with the trial data and add these incrementally?
2. Regarding Multi-Counter POS Operations - should each counter/device maintain its own isolated session with independent cash drawers and end-of-day reconciliation, or should there be a shared session where all counters contribute to a single cash drawer that's reconciled collectively?
3. For FEFO (First Expiry, First Out) enforcement at POS - if the system automatically selects a batch that's expiring soon but there's adequate stock of batches with later expiry dates, should we: (a) force the near-expiry batch sale, (b) show a warning but allow override, or (c) offer the customer a discount automatically to move near-expiry stock?
4. In the 3-Way Matching process for procurement - when there's a price variance between PO and invoice (e.g., supplier increases price without notice), should the system: (a) auto-reject and require new PO, (b) flag for manual approval with tolerance threshold, or (c) create a price variance journal entry and proceed?
5. For AI-Powered Reorder Suggestions - should the system learn from user behavior when they dismiss or modify suggestions (to improve future recommendations), or should it strictly follow the configured min/max levels and forecasts without learning from manual overrides?
6. Regarding Customer Tier Management - you mentioned "indicative tier upgrade rules" that aren't auto-enforced. Should the system still notify staff when a customer meets upgrade criteria, or is it purely informational in reports without any proactive alerts?
7. For Offline-First POS - when a device comes back online after extended offline operation (e.g., 24+ hours), should it: (a) sync all queued transactions immediately regardless of volume, (b) batch sync in chunks to prevent server overload, or (c) prompt user to review offline transactions before syncing?
8. In Multi-Location Transfer workflows - when items are marked "In-Transit," should the inventory be: (a) invisible to both locations until received, (b) visible but non-sellable at both locations, or (c) shown separately as "in-transit inventory" that can be tracked but not used?
9. For Batch Recall Management - when a batch is recalled, should the system: (a) immediately block all sales of that batch, (b) show warnings but allow sales with manager override, or (c) automatically generate return transactions for all customers who purchased from that batch?
10. Regarding Role-Based Dashboards - should users with multiple roles see: (a) a combined dashboard with widgets from all their roles, (b) separate dashboards they can switch between, or (c) a customizable dashboard where they select which role's widgets to display?

# Here are your answers. 
1. See the anonymous users when they start trying out our app will be on-boarded through the on-boarding process. So when they upgrade to authenticate it from anonymous, they would already have their information like business name, suppliers, initial inventory, and first location etc etc. So no need to do a progressive onboarding at this stage. However,  when they upgrade to authenticated from anonymous, we will prompt the user to treat their entire/partial  initial  data (while they were anonymous users) be treated as a sample data and a check mark to pick and choose to include the sample data selectively from their  anonymous period into their core business after becoming authenticated users. 
2. Each counter/device maintains its own isolated session with independent characters and end of the reconciliation. 
3. Show a warning, but also allow override if the customer asks for a longer expiry stock. That should be logged to the manager, 
4.  Flag for manual approve install with tolerance thresholds defined by the business admin. 
5. This should be a configurable setting by the admin, and the default should be that the system learns from manual overrides. 
6. Yes, notify the customer management department. 
7. Sync all queued transactions immediately, regardless of the volume. 
8. show separately as in-transit inventory 
9. Immediately block all sales of that batch. 
10. A customizable combined dashboard with all widgets from their roles.
