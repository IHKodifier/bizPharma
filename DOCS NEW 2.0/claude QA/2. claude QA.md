1. For the MVP launch, which feature modules are absolutely critical versus which can be deferred to Phase 2? (I see 10+ major modules - POS, Inventory, Procurement, Suppliers, HR/Payroll, Reporting, etc. - and need to understand priorities to avoid over-engineering the initial architecture)
2. What are your expected scale targets for the MVP phase? Specifically: number of businesses (tenants), transactions per day per business, and concurrent users per business?
3. Since you're using Firebase Data Connect with PostgreSQL, have you decided on the database multi-tenancy strategy: (a) Shared database with tenant_id columns, (b) Schema per tenant, or (c) Database per tenant?
4. For the "frontend only talks to secured API endpoints" requirement - should the FastAPI backend sit between Flutter and Firebase services (acting as a BFF/API Gateway), or will Flutter make direct calls to Firebase Auth/Data Connect while using FastAPI only for business logic?
5. What are your offline-first requirements for MVP? Should core POS operations work completely offline with background sync, or is occasional connectivity acceptable with optimistic updates?
6. For the AI-powered reorder intelligence and analytics features - are these required for MVP, or can they be Phase 2 enhancements built on top of the core transactional system?
7. What's your data residency requirement? Will you need to support multi-region deployments (e.g., Pakistan data stays in specific regions), or is a single global deployment acceptable for MVP?
8. For the modular architecture that can be reused across sectors - do you want to architect for this extensibility from day one, or focus on pharmacy-specific implementation first and refactor for modularity later?

# here are Here are your answers. 
1. for the MVP, must have modules are ...
    * Authentication & User Management
    * Business Onboarding & Configuration
    * POS
    * Inventory
    * Batch & Expiry Management
    * Procurement  & Purchase Management
    * Multi-Location & Transfer Management
    * Customer Management
    * Financial Accounting
    * Supplier Management
    * Customer Management
    * AI-Powered Intelligence
    * Import/Export & Data Management
    * Reporting
## the ones parked for post MVP are 
* Prescription & Regulatory Compliance
* Human Resources & Payroll
2. I have no idea for the scale, but I would love the app to be able to cater for 50,000 tenants without a glitch. 
3. Share database with tenant ID columns. 
4. Flutter will make direct calls to Firebase Auth/Data Connect while using FastAPI only for business logic.
5. Core POS operations should work completely offline with background sync.
6. AI-powered reorder intelligence and analytics features are required for MVP.
7. No multi-region deployment requirements. 
8. focus on pharmacy-specific implementation first and refactor for modularity later?
