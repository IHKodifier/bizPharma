You must follow these rules:

- **Bold simplicity** with intuitive navigation creating frictionless experiences
- **Dark/Light Themes**the app requires both light/dark themes with a one click toggle to switch betwen dark/light theme accessible from almost all screens  
- **Breathable whitespace** complemented by strategic color accents for visual hierarchy  
- **Strategic negative space** calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization  
- **Systematic color theory** applied through subtle gradients and purposeful accent placement.
- **Strategic color theory**: Apply a limited palette with purposeful accent colors for hierarchy and action cues.
- **Typography hierarchy** utilizing weight variance and proportional scaling for information architecture  
- **Visual density optimization** balancing information availability with cognitive load management  
- **Motion choreography** implementing physics-based transitions for spatial continuity  
- **Accessibility-driven contrast ratios** paired with intuitive navigation patterns ensuring universal usability  
- **Feedback responsiveness via state transitions** communicating system status with minimal latency  
- **Content-first layouts** prioritizing user objectives over decorative elements for task efficiency  
- **User goals and tasks** Understanding what users need to accomplish and designing to make those primary tasks seamless and efficient  
- **Information architecture** Organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that matches users' mental models  
- **Progressive disclosure** Revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while still providing access to advanced features  
- **Visual hierarchy** Using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most important elements first  
- **Affordances and signifiers** Making interactive elements clearly identifiable through visual cues that indicate how they work  
- **Consistency** Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens to reduce cognitive load  
- **Accessibility** Ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen readers, keyboard navigation)  
- **Error prevention** Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than just handling errors after they occur  
- **Feedback** Providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail, and communicating system status at all times  
- **Performance considerations** Accounting for loading times and designing appropriate loading states  
- **Mobile vs. desktop considerations** Adapting layouts and interactions for different device capabilities and contexts  
- **Responsive design** Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and orientations  
- **User testing feedback loops** Incorporating iterative testing to validate assumptions and improve the design  
- **Platform conventions** Following established patterns from iOS/Android/Web to meet user expectations  
- **Microcopy and content strategy**  Crafting clear, concise text that guides users through the experience  
- **Aesthetic appeal** Creating a visually pleasing design that aligns with brand identity while prioritizing usability  
- **Animations** Crafting beautiful yet subtle animations and transitions that make the app feel professional
- **Aesthetic appeal**: Maintain a visually pleasing, brand-aligned look while prioritizing usability.
